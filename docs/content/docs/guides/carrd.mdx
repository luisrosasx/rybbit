Carrd is a popular platform for building simple, responsive one-page sites. You can add Rybbit Analytics to track visitors on your Carrd site.

<Callout type="warn">
Adding custom code requires a **Carrd Pro** subscription (Pro Standard, Pro Plus, or Pro Max).
</Callout>

## How to Add Rybbit to Carrd

<Steps>
<Step>
### Open Your Site Settings

1. Log in to Carrd and open your site in the editor
2. Click on the **Settings** icon (gear) in the top right
3. Select the **Settings** tab
</Step>

<Step>
### Add Head Code

1. Scroll down to the **Head** section under "Embed Code"
2. Paste the following code:

```html
<script>
(function() {
  var s = document.createElement('script');
  s.src = 'https://app.rybbit.io/api/script.js';
  s.defer = true;
  s.setAttribute('data-site-id', 'YOUR_SITE_ID');
  document.head.appendChild(s);
})();
</script>
```

Replace `YOUR_SITE_ID` with your actual Site ID from your Rybbit dashboard.
</Step>

<Step>
### Publish Your Site

Click **Save** then **Publish** to apply the changes to your live site.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
We use the JavaScript approach instead of a plain script tag because some site builders may strip `data-*` attributes during processing.
</Callout>

## Using Multiple Pages

If your Carrd site has multiple pages (Pro Plus or Pro Max feature), the tracking script in the head code will automatically load on all pages.

## Troubleshooting

### Script not working

1. Make sure you have a Carrd Pro subscription
2. Ensure you published the site after adding the code
3. Check "View Page Source" on your live site and search for `rybbit`

### Form submissions

To track form submissions as events, you can add a custom event using Carrd's form settings or by adding additional JavaScript in the embed code section.
