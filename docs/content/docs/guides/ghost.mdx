Ghost is a powerful publishing platform for blogs and publications. You can easily add Rybbit Analytics using Ghost's built-in code injection feature.

## How to Add Rybbit to Ghost

<Steps>
<Step>
### Access Code Injection Settings

1. Log in to your Ghost Admin panel
2. Go to **Settings** (gear icon in the bottom left)
3. Scroll down and click on **Code injection**
</Step>

<Step>
### Add the Tracking Script

In the **Site Header** section, paste the following code:

```html
<script
  src="https://app.rybbit.io/api/script.js"
  data-site-id="YOUR_SITE_ID"
  defer
></script>
```

Replace `YOUR_SITE_ID` with your actual Site ID from your Rybbit dashboard.
</Step>

<Step>
### Save Changes

Click **Save** in the top right corner. The script will now be loaded on all pages of your Ghost site.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

### Script not appearing

1. Make sure you clicked **Save** after adding the code
2. Clear your browser cache and refresh the page
3. Check "View Page Source" and search for `rybbit` to verify the script is present

### Using a Ghost theme with custom code

If your theme has its own code injection or you're modifying theme files directly, you can add the script to your theme's `default.hbs` file, just before the closing `</head>` tag.

### Membership/Subscriber tracking

Ghost's membership features work normally with Rybbit. All page views, including member-only content, will be tracked (for visitors who have access to view the content).
